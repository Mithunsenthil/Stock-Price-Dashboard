# Stock Price Dashboard

## Overview

Welcome to the **Real-Time Stock Price Dashboard** built using **Streamlit** and **yfinance**! This web application provides real-time stock data for major Nifty 50 companies. Users can select a stock from a list of top companies, choose the desired time interval (ranging from minutes to years), and view the stock's price movements over time, along with other important details like open, close, high, low, and volume.

The dashboard allows users to quickly visualize the stock data with an interactive line chart and access key stock information, including market capitalization, sector, and company name.
